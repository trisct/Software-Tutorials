# Building LibTorch App

Do as follows

1. Extract the include and library files downloaded from the official website to a predefined path
2. Add the library folder to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable (for dynamic linking)
3. Add the appropriate flags to the compiler (if you compile with terminal directly). See the custom `build.sh` for an example
